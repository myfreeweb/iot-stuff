# IoT stuff

(WIP)

- using [Sming](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming), a C++ framework for the ESP8266
- [cantcoap](https://github.com/staropram/cantcoap) for [CoAP](http://coap.technology)
- `can-has-coap` is my horrible C++ routing layer above `cantcoap`

built with `can-has-coap`:
- `esp-room-sensors`
- `esp-plant-sensors`
